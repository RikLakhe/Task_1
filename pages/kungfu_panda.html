             Kung Fu Panda (2008), Kung Fu Panda 2 (2011) and Kung Fu Panda 3 (2016). 
             The first two were distributed by Paramount Pictures, while the third film was distributed by 
             20th Century Fox. Three shorts, Secrets of the Furious Five (2008),
              Kung Fu Panda Holiday Special (2010) and Kung Fu Panda: Secrets of the Masters (2011),
               were also released. A television series for Nickelodeon television network, 
               Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness, premiered in 2011. A second series, 
               Kung Fu Panda: The Paws of Destiny, was released on Amazon Prime in November 2018. <br>
               The franchise, set in a fantasy wuxia genre version of ancient China populated by 
               anthropomorphic animals, features the adventures of Po Ping, a giant panda, 
               who was improbably chosen as the prophesied Dragon Warrior. 
               Although his status is initially doubted, Po proves himself worthy as he strives to fulfill
                his destiny and learn about his past with his new friends.</p>
