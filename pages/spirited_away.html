              Spirited Away tells the story of Chihiro Ogino (Hiiragi), a ten-year-old girl who, 
              while moving to a new neighborhood, enters the world of Kami (spirits of Japanese Shinto folklore).
               After her parents are turned into pigs by the witch Yubaba (Natsuki), 
               Chihiro takes a job working in Yubaba's bathhouse to find a way to free herself and her parents
                and return to the human world. <br>
