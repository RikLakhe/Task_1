            Spirited Away is a 2001 Japanese animated fantasy film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki,
             animated by Studio Ghibli for Tokuma Shoten, Nippon Television Network, Dentsu, 
             Buena Vista Home Entertainment, Tohokushinsha Film, and Mitsubishi.
              The film features the voices of Rumi Hiiragi, Miyu Irino, Mari Natsuki, Takeshi Naito, 
              Yasuko Sawaguchi, Tsunehiko Kamij≈ç, Takehiko Ono, and Bunta Sugawara. 
              Spirited Away tells the story of Chihiro Ogino (Hiiragi), a ten-year-old girl who, 
              while moving to a new neighborhood, enters the world of Kami (spirits of Japanese Shinto folklore).
               After her parents are turned into pigs by the witch Yubaba (Natsuki), 
               Chihiro takes a job working in Yubaba's bathhouse to find a way to free herself and her parents
                and return to the human world. <br>
                It won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards,
                 making it the first, and to date only hand-drawn and non-English-language animated film 
                 to win the award. It was the co-recipient of the Golden Bear at the 2002 Berlin International
                  Film Festival (shared with Bloody Sunday), and is within the top ten on the British Film 
                  Institute's list of "Top 50 films for children up to the age of 14".
                   In 2016, it was voted the fourth-best film of the 21st century by the BBC,
                    as picked by 177 film critics from around the world, 
                    making it the highest-ranking animated film on the list.
